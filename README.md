# Group-Verification
A collection of scripts that can be used to find groups that have the potential to be utilized in faster matrix multiplication algorithms

To run in GAP: use the read() function
The script should print the size of the group, as well as the number of "successes"
The greater the size and proportion of successes, the "better" the group
